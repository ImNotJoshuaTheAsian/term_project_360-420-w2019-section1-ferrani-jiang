Skipping a stone: how many times can we possibly skip a stone in a lake given its initial angle of attack?
Goals of the simulation
The goal of our simulation is to first, calculate the maximum number of skips possibly done given initial conditions, and second, graph the trajectory of the stone on the lake in a coordinate system of x with respect to y (with y = 0 at water level).
Theory and equations
There are two major stages of the trajectory of the stones. There is first the “projectile” stage, where the stone’s acceleration is only affected by gravity and drag. It occurs when the stone is above water level (y > 0). Second, there is the “collision” stage. It occurs when the stone is at or below water level (y =< 0).

The projectile is moving under constant acceleration
